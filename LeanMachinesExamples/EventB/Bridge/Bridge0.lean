# The Event-B Bridge example

This example specification is a version of the infamous
Event-B Bridge model of the Event-B book (chapter ).
Only the abstract machine and the two first refinement steps
have been formalized for now.

While more feature of the LeanMachines framework could have
been used in practice (e.g. functional refinement), we sticked
to "standard" Event-B features. There are of course notable
differences, among them:

 - the use of type theory rather than untyped set theory
 (although we rely on Mathlib's typed finite sets)

 - proof details are of course different (although the proof "strategy"
  is the same as in the book)

 - the state variables and the event names have been made more explicit

Note that it is best to follow the Bridge specification with a copy of the
 Event-B book aside.
